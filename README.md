### Tablaeu Description
This dashboard provides an analytical summary of air quality based on the UCI Air Quality dataset, visualized through an interactive Tableau dashboard. The dataset comprises hourly readings of various air pollutants and meteorological variables, offering insights into environmental conditions over time. The visuals highlight key trends, correlations, and patterns that inform air pollution levels and their possible causes.
1. Temporal Trends in Air Pollution
- Time series visualizations effectively capture fluctuations in pollutants like CO, NO2, and O3 over time.
- Daily and seasonal patterns reveal notable variations, with peak pollution levels often occurring during specific times of the day, likely tied to traffic congestion and industrial operations.
- The dashboard enables clear month-over-month comparisons, highlighting seasonal shifts in air quality.
2. Correlation Between Pollutants
- Heatmaps and scatter plots demonstrate strong relationships between pollutants, particularly CO and NO2, pointing to shared sources such as vehicle emissions and combustion processes.
- A negative correlation between O3 and NO2 is observed, consistent with photochemical reactions where sunlight converts NO2 into O3.
3. Meteorological Impact on Air Quality
- Visualizations of temperature and humidity show that air pollution levels often increase under specific weather conditions.
- Analysis of wind speed indicates that higher wind velocities improve air quality by dispersing pollutants more effectively.
4. Geographic and Urban Implications
- If spatial data is included, the visuals could reveal pollution disparities across different areas, supporting urban planning and policy-making efforts.
5. Anomalies and Outliers in Air Quality Data
- Box plots and distribution charts help identify extreme pollution events and outliers, which may result from sudden industrial emissions or unusual meteorological conditions.
